PandaMovies is a Desktop App similar to IMDB. You can find many Movies all over the world. In this app you can search for movies, rate them, even add them to your favorite list. Also you can see details about the movie like casting or the genre of the movie. We added also an option that you can search a user and see the common movies that you both have.
